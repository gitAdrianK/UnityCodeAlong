Coding along with ComradeNerdy without any Unity experience.

## The folder structure for Assets is build along the following concepts:
- Every scene has a folder.
- Every script inside a scene folder may only be used inside the scene.
- Scripts inside the Global folder may be used everywhere.

## What to find inside the folders:
- Scene folders contain objects and its associated files used *ONLY* in the scene.
- The Global folder contains implementations of various data that may be used everywhere.
